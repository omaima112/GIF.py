## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create animated **GIFs** using Python. By leveraging the **imageio** library, you can combine multiple images into a single looping GIF with minimal code. The program reads images stored in a folder, stores them in a list, and then writes them as a GIF file with a specified frame duration and loop count. This approach allows users to animate any set of images, making it ideal for _creating fun visuals, memes, or simple graphic presentations without relying on paid online tools._ The project emphasizes simplicity, teaching fundamental **_Python_** concepts like lists, loops, and working with external libraries, while producing a tangible and visually appealing output. Users can customize the GIF by adding more images, adjusting the frame duration, or controlling the number of loops, making it both educational and practical.

## Key Components

*   Python – The programming language used to write the script.
*   ImageIO Library – Handles reading images and writing them into a GIF file.
*   Image Files – PNG images (e.g., nyan-cat1.png, nyan-cat2.png, nyan-cat3.png) that are combined into the GIF.
*   List – Stores the file paths and image data for processing.
*   For Loop – Iterates through the image files and loads them into memory.
*   imread() Method – Reads individual images from the file system.
*   imwrite() Method – Writes the list of images into a GIF with specified duration and loop settings.
*   Duration Parameter – Controls how long each frame appears in the GIF (in milliseconds).
*   Loop Parameter – Determines whether the GIF repeats infinitely or a fixed number of times.

## Key Features

*   Easy GIF Creation – Combine multiple images into a single animated GIF with minimal code.
*   Customizable Frame Duration – Control how long each image appears in the GIF.
*   Loop Control – Set the GIF to loop infinitely or a specific number of times.
*   Supports Multiple Images – Works with two or more images of the same dimensions.
*   Lightweight and Fast – Uses the lightweight imageio library for quick processing.
*   No Paid Tools Required – Fully Python-based solution without relying on online GIF makers.
*   Educational – Demonstrates basic Python concepts like lists, loops, and library usage.
*   Highly Customizable – Users can add more images, adjust duration, and create GIFs for any purpose.
